This is the code for the paper "Comparing integrated heat stress indicators with raw climate variables in predicting heat stroke-related ambulance transportations in Japan" led by Q.G.

This repository includes the Python and R scripts to plot the main figures in the manuscript (i.e., Figs 1-5 in the main text) and the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).

This script was developed and tested in Python 3.7.12, R 4.0.3, and Linux platforms, and it can also be run on Windows with proper environment settings.
